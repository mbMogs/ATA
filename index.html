					<p> 
            My childhood dream was to travel the world and experience
            the cultures<br> from around the globe. In December of 1989, 
            I received an invitation<br> to attend flight attendant training
            with ATA Airlines. After 4 weeks of<br> training, I earned my
            wings and I became FA #94999. I couldn't wait<br> for my
             adventures to begin!

          <p>My first base was at Chicago O'Hare International<br>
             Airport (ORD). I worked some fun filled charters<br> 
             to many cities, including London, Paris, Rome,<br>
             and Cairo. Desert Shield/Desert Storm started and I had<br>
             the privilege of flying the troops around during the Gulf war.<br>
             I remember looking down at the Persian Gulf and seeing<br> 
             the warships lined up in the waters. It was quite a sight<br>
             to behold. I also worked a trip to Somalia to evacuate the<br> 
             US Embassy, which had come under attack during civil unrest.

          <p>Hawaii, Washington D.C. and Seattle were my favorite domestic layovers.</p>

          <p> I was in London the week Princess Diana was killed in a car accident.<br> 
            I placed flowers near her memorial at Kensington Palace.<br> 
            It was a very sad time in England.</p>

          <p>I enjoyed working luxury "around the world" trips on the L1011.<br>
              My South America trip included layovers in Mexico, Ecuador,<br> 
              Easter Island, Machu Picchu, Iguazu Falls, Argentina and Brazil.<br> 
              Experiencing the cultures of these places was such a thrill.

           <p>  I also worked a trip which visited Japan,<br> 
                Thailand, India, Greece, Crete, and Spain.<br> 
                Touring the cities and experiencing the cultures<br> 
                at each stop was an amazing experience.

            <p>Once the Iraq War started, most of my trips<br>
              involved bringing the troops back and forth<br>
              from the war. Working with the military was<br>
              one of the highlights of my aviation career.</p>

           <p class ="funParagraph"> On April 3, 2008, ATA Airlines closed its doors for good.<br>
            My ATA adventures and the many friends that I made<br>
                will always be a treasured part of my life.
